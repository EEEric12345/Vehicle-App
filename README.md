## APCSA 2024 Sem2 Final Project
Develop a system for renting vehicles with different types such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Use inheritance to create a base class `Vehicle` with subclasses like `Car`, `Truck`, and `Motorcycle`. Include features such as rental rates, availability, and maintenance schedules, showcasing inheritance to reuse code for common functionalities.
